# Project Name

Provide a brief description of your project here. This project includes a Node.js application and utilizes CodeceptJS, Playwright, and Allure for testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: The project requires Node.js to run backend scripts or develop in a Node.js environment.
- **Docker (Optional)**: For containerization, Docker is used to create a consistent running environment for the project.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Node.js

1. **Download Node.js**:
   - Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download the Node.js installer.
   - Choose the "LTS" version recommended for most users.
   - Download the Windows Installer (.msi).

2. **Run the Installer**:
   - Execute the downloaded `.msi` installer.
   - Follow the installer steps, agree to the license agreement, and click the `Next` button until the installation begins.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open your Command Prompt and run the following command to check that Node.js is installed:
     ```bash
     node -v
     ```
   - This should print the Node.js version installed on your system.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZainabEman/SQE_TestOps.git
cd SQE_TestOps
Step 3: Install Project Dependencies
Run the following command in your command prompt to install all the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
This command will install all dependencies defined in the package.json file.

Step 4: Run the Tests
To execute the test cases, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm test
This command will execute all tests and display the results in the terminal.

Step 5: Generate Test Reports
If your tests are set up to generate reports (e.g., using Allure), run the following command to generate and view the reports:

bash
Copy code
npx allure generate output/allure-results --clean
npx allure open
This will generate a report based on the test results stored in output/allure-results and open it in your default web browser.

Step 6: Running the Application
If your project includes a web server or any application that needs to be run, use:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This command will start the application as per the script defined in the package.json file.
